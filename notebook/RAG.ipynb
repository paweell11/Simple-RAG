    "### Why Text Splitting is Not Necessary for Our Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing our Simple Wikipedia dataset, we found that text splitting (chunking) is not necessary for this particular dataset. Our dataset contains 769,764 non-empty documents with an average length of only 183 characters (46 tokens) and a median of 127 characters (32 tokens). Even the 95th percentile is just 558 characters (140 tokens), which is well below the typical embedding model limits of 512-8192 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most embedding models can easily handle documents of this size, splitting our already short Wikipedia articles would actually be counterproductive. Text splitting is typically needed when documents are very long (>1000 characters) or exceed model token limits, but our dataset doesn't meet these criteria. Keeping the documents intact preserves the complete context of each Wikipedia article, results in better embeddings, and simplifies our RAG pipeline. We can proceed directly to embedding generation without any chunking steps."

The day to day changes in this level of air are named weather; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate. Rain and storms are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up. The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water) gets water in it but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle. ...\n"
